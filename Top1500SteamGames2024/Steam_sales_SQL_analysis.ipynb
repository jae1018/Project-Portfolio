    "2) We can take the precision just out to the first decimal point (making the uncertainty 0.1 hours, or 6 minutes, which really shouldn't make a difference)\n",

    "\n",
    "1) **The average revenue brought in by Indie publishers is \\\\$0.67M with AA 10x and AAA 45x higher.** The minimum revenue for AA and Indie publishers was about \\\\$21K with \\\\$26K being the minimum for AAA (but this is limited by the data we're given - which is just the top 1500 earning steam sales between January and August 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **For the probability of the revenue bracket given the publisher class ( $prob (rB | pC)$ ), we found that there was slightly higher chances of a AA game earning >\\$1M in revenue than a AAA publisher**. While we're not given the profits or the production costs associated with the developers or publishers, AA publishers generally have less costs than AAA so there's a <u>reduced risk</u> in generating a higher profit by investing with a AA publisher.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **The probability of the publisher class given the revenue bracket ( $prob (pC | rB)$ ) showed that the highest revenue bracket was evenly split between AA and Indie publishers.** Like costs between AA and AAA, Indie publishers usually have lowers costs than AA (sometimes even much lower). These can be invested in a sort of 'long-shot' investments: Great if they win big, but no large loss if they break even or fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall recommendation:** Primarily invest in AA publishers due to their demonstrated capacity to earn into the higher revenue brackets while having lower operational costs than AAA. If additional funds are available, then diversify and invest in a variety of Indie publishers due to their likely lower operational costs."
